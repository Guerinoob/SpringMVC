# SpringMVC

This repository contains all the Spring projects I made during my courses.

Each "tdX" project is a different project.

The "td0" is the introduction to SpringMVC framework and to the concepts of controllers, templates...

The "td1" follows the td0 : it is the same project but with a more advanced use of the framework.

The "td2" is a web application that stores organizations, groups and users. It uses Hibernate to store datas in a database, and introduces the cocnept of entities, repositories etc.
There is no td3 because it was the same project than td2.

The "td4" follows the tds 2 et 3 and adds VueJS components and REST use.

The "td5" is the last project : it's an application that stores users and scripts for each user. There's a login / logout system, and each user can see or modify only its scripts.
The "td6" is the same project, with REST implementation and a search tool for the scripts.
